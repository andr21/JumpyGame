//to do
// how should connection weights and node bias' be amended "peturbed"?
// activation functions???
// when adding a node, delete the old connection or disable it? this would impact fullyConnected() also.
// mutate to be able to remove a connection maybe?
// enable/disable connections
// NEATJS initial weights of new connections in addnode are wrong
//do we need to enable/disable connections, cant we just delete them? the innovation numbers takes care of the differences no?
//hmmmm i dont know if this innovation number method is correct .. because what if you get a "node 5" added to a completely differnt place? .. maybe it's okay
